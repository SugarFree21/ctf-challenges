# CTF Challenges  
This repository contains all of the CTF challenges that I've created for BYU CTFs. 

## Background  
From May 2023 to April 2024 I served as a CTF lead for BYU's Cybersecurity Student Association. During this time I helped run two public CTFs (BYU 2023 & BYU 2024) and three internal CTFs for the college, plus taught at dozens of training sessions. I've tried to compile everything I created here. 

## Use
Feel free to use any of these challenges for your own purposes (as long as you don't do illegal stuff), that's what open source is all about ;)
