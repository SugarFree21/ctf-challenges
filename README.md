# CTF Challenges  
This repository contains all of the CTF challenges that I've created for BYU CTFs. 

## Background  
From May 2023 to April 2024 I served as a CTF lead for BYU's Cybersecurity Student Association. During this time I helped run two public CTFs (BYU 2023 & BYU 2024) and three internal CTFs for the college, plus taught at dozens of training sessions. For the most part I focused on OSINT, Web, Password Cracking, and Misc challenges, although I dabbled in a couple of others for super basic competitions.
