      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, some students thought that hacking was fun. Fast forward a couple of years, some taco bell runs, a few dozen heated arguments, many fortnite sessions (and maybe and assignment or two), here we are.</p>
      <p>Good luck with the CTF, and may the force be ever in your favor.</p>
