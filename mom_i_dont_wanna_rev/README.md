## Challenge

Rating: intermediate

Provide the following to challengers:
```
*mom and teenage son are exploring caverns together*

"Hey son, I found a binary! Can you rev it for me real quick?"

"mom, I don't wanna rev..."
```

Also provide `mom` located in this directory.

## Solve theory

The binary accepts input and looks for the flag based on the hex values of each character. Ghidra can figure out what the binary is trying to do pretty well, so reassembling the flag from there should be pretty easy.
