The precise alignment of the stars and planets that allows entry into the Tomb of Nefertiti only happens every ten years. You've made your way to Egypt and have snuck into the tomb, only to discover that the treasure is gone! Some of the marks on the walls are much more recent than Nefertiti's time... it looks like another CTF team found their way in here when it was last open 10 years ago! Several of the hyroglyphics have been vandalized, with messages about the best CTF team in the world conquering the tomb. It's up to you track them down. Who was the top CTF team in the world 10 years ago?

Flag format: byuctf{Name of Team}

`byuctf{Plaid Parliament of Pwning}`
