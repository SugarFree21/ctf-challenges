In classic OSINT fashion I'm not going to try and relate this to Egyptian Pyramids in any way, I'm just going to ask you one incredibly specific and random question that you have to answer. Good luck. 

What is the address of the place that Warren Buffett lived while attending the University of Nebraska?

## Solve Theory
Warren Buffet only spent a short time at the University of Nebraska, but he was there in 1950 when the census was taken. There might be other places this is documented, but the intended solve is to locate Warren Buffett in the 1950 census where he is listed as living at 1825 Pepper Ave as a lodger.
